## CS 4442: Artificial Intelligence II
### Assignment 1: Math, Linear and Polynomial Regression, Regularization and Cross-Validation
Did some Gradient and Hessian math, linear and polynomial regression on some data to compare degree performance, and then implemented regularization on polynomial regression with cross validation.
### Assignment 2: Generative Models, Naive Bayes, Kernels, PCA and Eigenface
Probability Bayes questions, Kernel validation and proofs, and PCA for analysis of face images with eigenvalue stuff.
### Assignment 3: Edge Detection and Corner Detection
Convolution process implementation with Gaussian and Sobel filters, Harris Corner Detection
### Assignment 4: AlexNet and RDM
Used pre-trained AlexNet deep learning model to extract feature maps and activations, made RDMs and corresponding MDS and compared the layers.
